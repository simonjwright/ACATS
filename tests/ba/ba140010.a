--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--    Check that a compilation unit is illegal if it depends on an earlier
--    version of itself. Part 1: normal with.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--    This checks the last portion of 10.1.4(5). This rule essentially says
--    that a compilation unit cannot with itself, directly or indirectly.
--
--    As is usual for clause 10 tests, the source files after the first
--    represent later edits of the source code by the programmer. Test
--    scripts need to take care that the files are presented to the compiler
--    one at a time, not all at the same time.
--
--    We test mostly specifications that don't require bodies, but we use
--    subprogram bodies to ensure that replacement is not involved.
--
-- TEST FILES:
--      This test consists of the following files:
--      -> BA140010.A
--         BA140011.A
--         BA140012.A
--         BA140013.A
--         BA140014.A
--         BA140015.A
--         BA140016.A
--         BA140017.A
--         BA140018.A
--         BA140019.A
--         BA14001A.A
--
-- PASS/FAIL CRITERIA:
--      Files BA140011.A, BA140012.A, BA140013.A, BA140014.A, BA140015.A,
--      BA140016.A, BA140017.A, BA140018.A, BA140019.A, and
--      BA14001A.A contain errors. All errors in these files
--      must be detected to pass the test.
--      Compiling the generic subprogram bodies BA14001H and
--      BA14001A.Daughter is optional.
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--    15 Feb 2018  RLB  Created test from legacy test BA1101E, adding many
--                      Ada 95 test cases.
