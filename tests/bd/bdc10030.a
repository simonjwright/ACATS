--
--     The ACAA has created and maintains the Ada Conformity Assessment Test
--     Suite for the purpose of conformity assessments conducted in accordance
--     with the International Standard ISO/IEC 18009 - Ada: Conformity
--     assessment of a language processor. This test suite should not be used
--     to make claims of conformance unless used in accordance with
--     ISO/IEC 18009 and any applicable ACAA procedures.

--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--     Check that the restriction_parameter_argument of restriction
--     No_Use_of_Pragma can be any identifier.
--
--     Check that a use of an pragma mentioned in a restriction
--     No_Use_of_Pragma is detected.
--
--     Check that the restriction No_Use_of_Pragma only applies to the
--     current compilation.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--     We follow the great tradition of the ACATS (see tests B28001A-B28001W),
--     and use the names of ARG and WG 9 leaders as implementation-defined
--     pragma names. We don't even want names that exist anyway, so the more
--     unlikely the name, the better.
--
--     We try the obsolescent pragmas Pack and Inline as it doesn't make
--     sense to use this restriction to prevent the use of a configuration
--     pragma (such a pragma would have to be directly next to the restriction
--     to be restricted, such pragmas can't be buried deep in other source
--     code), and it seems useful to prevent an obsolescent form.
--
--     We try a second compilation in which we use the prohibited pragmas,
--     in order to check that the restriction doesn't last too long.
--
-- TEST FILES:
--      This test consists of the following files:
--      -> BDC10030.A
--         BDC10031.A
--
-- PASS/FAIL CRITERIA:
--      File BDC10030.A contains errors. All errors in this file must be 
--      detected to pass the test. Additionally, no errors may be detected in
--      file BDC10031.A.

-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      30 Sep 21   RLB     Created test.

pragma Restrictions (No_Use_of_Pragma => Pack);         -- OK. {0}

pragma Restrictions (No_Use_of_Pragma => Inline);       -- OK. {0}

pragma Restrictions (No_Use_of_Pragma => Erhard_Ploedereder); -- OK. {0}

pragma Restrictions (No_Use_of_Pragma => Joyce_Tokar);  -- OK. {0}
   -- Note: We allow any legal identifier here, not just Pragmas defined
   -- by the current implementation, as we want to be able to
   -- specify implementation-defined Pragmas for some other
   -- implementation; these may be totally unknown to the implementation
   -- that is processing the restriction pragma.

   -- Note: Pragma Restrictions is a configuration pragma, and thus applies to
   -- all of the units in a compilation, and has to be placed before any units
   -- of a compilation (see 10.1.5(8)). This particular restriction only
   -- applies to this compilation, not the entire partition.
   -- Therefore, the permission 10.1.5(9/2) does not apply and a compiler
   -- must accept the above and apply the restrictions to the following
   -- compilation units (and no others).

package BDC10030 is


   type Str is array (1..10) of Character;
   pragma Pack(Str);                                         -- ERROR: {4}


   function Foo (I : in Integer) return Integer is (I*2);
   pragma Inline(Foo);                                       -- ERROR: {4}


   type OK_Str is array (1..10) of Character with Pack;      -- OK. {4}
      -- The restriction only prevents using the pragma.
      -- If you wanted to prevent packing any type, you
      -- could have used restriction No_Specification_of_Aspect instead.

   function Bar (I : in Integer) return Integer is (I*2)
      with Inline;                                           -- OK. {1:4}
