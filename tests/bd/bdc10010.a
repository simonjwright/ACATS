--
--     The ACAA has created and maintains the Ada Conformity Assessment Test
--     Suite for the purpose of conformity assessments conducted in accordance
--     with the International Standard ISO/IEC 18009 - Ada: Conformity
--     assessment of a language processor. This test suite should not be used
--     to make claims of conformance unless used in accordance with
--     ISO/IEC 18009 and any applicable ACAA procedures.

--
-- OBJECTIVE:
--     Check that the restriction_parameter_argument of restriction
--     No_Use_of_Attribute can be any identifier (or one of the allowed
--     reserved words).
--
--     Check that a use of an attribute mentioned in a restriction
--     No_Use_of_Attribute is detected.
--
--     Check that the restriction No_Use_of_Attribute only applies to the
--     current compilation.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--     We follow the great tradition of the ACATS (see tests B28001A-B28001W),
--     and use the names of ARG chairmen as implementation-defined attribute
--     names. We don't even want names that exist anyway, so the more
--     unlikely the name, the better.
--
--     We check an attribute with the name of a reserved word ("Access")
--     as well as a normal identifier. We chose Access and Unchecked_Access
--     to test here, as these are likely things that a particular project
--     might want to avoid. We don't try to test every attribute (there are
--     a lot of them).
--
--     We try a second compilation in which we use the prohibited attributes,
--     in order to check that the restriction doesn't last too long.
--
-- TEST FILES:
--      This test consists of the following files:
--      -> BDC10010.A
--         BDC10011.A
--
-- PASS/FAIL CRITERIA:
--      File BDC10010.A contains errors. All errors in this file must be 
--      detected to pass the test. Additionally, no errors may be detected in
--      file BDC10011.A.

-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      29 Sep 21   RLB     Created test.

pragma Restrictions (No_Use_of_Attribute => Unchecked_Access); -- OK. {0}

pragma Restrictions (No_Use_of_Attribute => Access);       -- OK. {0}

   -- Note: We allow any legal identifier here, not just attributes defined
   -- by the current implementation, as we want to be able to
   -- specify implementation-defined attributes for some other
   -- implementation; these may be totally unknown to the implementation
   -- that is processing the restriction pragma.

   -- Note: Pragma Restrictions is a configuration pragma, and thus applies to
   -- all of the units in a compilation, and has to be placed before any units
   -- of a compilation (see 10.1.5(8)). This particular restriction only
   -- applies to this compilation, not the entire partition.
   -- Therefore, the permission 10.1.5(9/2) does not apply and a compiler
   -- must accept the above and apply the restrictions to the following
   -- compilation units (and no others).
