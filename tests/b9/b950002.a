-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that primitive procedures of synchronized interfaces with
--      a Synchronization aspect cannot be completed with the wrong kind
--      of callable entity, nor can they have completions with a conflicting
--      Synchronization aspect.
--
-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      16 Nov 13   GRB     Initial version
--      26 Nov 13   RLB     Added missing headers, fixed objective.
--      22 Apr 14   RLB     Added additional case, renamed for ACATS 4.0.
--      23 Apr 21   RLB     Added error location indicators.
