--                                     Notice
--
--     The ACAA has created and maintains the Ada Conformity Assessment Test
--     Suite for the purpose of conformity assessments conducted in accordance
--     with the International Standard ISO/IEC 18009 - Ada: Conformity
--     assessment of a language processor. This test suite should not be used
--     to make claims of conformance unless used in accordance with
--     ISO/IEC 18009 and any applicable ACAA procedures.
--*
-- OBJECTIVE:
--      Check that an explicitly aliased parameter has the same
--      static accessibility level as a normal parameter unless it used to
--      compare with the level of the return object.
--
--      Check that "the master of the call" is correctly statically determined
--      for a call on a function containing explicitly aliased parameters.
--
-- TEST DESCRIPTION:
--      The rule for the first objective was clarified in AI05-0235-1, thus
--      it applies mainly to Ada 2012 and later. (As a correction, it could be
--      considered to apply to older versions of Ada, but we generally do not
--      enforce that in the ACATS.) This rule was then confirmed by AI12-0277-1
--      as issues had arisen in practice.
--
--      Additional changes to these rules were added by AI12-0345-1 (adding
--      the concept of "tied" for the purposes of static checks), AI12-0390-1
--      (which makes the special anonymous access rule apply to all such 
--      calls), and AI12-0402-1 (making the master of the call only depend on
--      the initialized object for composite types). As these changes are
--      corrections to Ada 2012, we generally allow compilers to implement
--      either the original rules or the new ones; we can only test cases 
--      where the result is the same for either set of rules. Therefore, some
--      test cases are commented out (and will be replaced in a future
--      Ada 202x test suite).
--
--      We used examples like the ones in all of those AIs, as well as
--      various legal cases to check that the rule is enforced correctly.
--
--      For the second objective, we only concern ourselves with cases where
--      it is clear that the master determined as "the master of the call"
--      is statically nested insider of the master that is being tested.
--      If this is not true, there would be no static check, but a dynamic
--      check might be necessary. Only 3.10.2(10.2/3, 10.3/3, and 10.6/3) are
--      testable here.

-- CHANGE HISTORY:
--      11 May 18   RLB     Initial version.
--      23 Dec 20   RLB     Test corrections, in part to reflect AI12-0345-1,
--                          AI12-0390-1, and AI12-0402-1.
