--
--     The ACAA has created and maintains the Ada Conformity Assessment Test
--     Suite for the purpose of conformity assessments conducted in accordance
--     with the International Standard ISO/IEC 18009 - Ada: Conformity
--     assessment of a language processor. This test suite should not be used
--     to make claims of conformance unless used in accordance with
--     ISO/IEC 18009 and any applicable ACAA procedures.
--*
--  OBJECTIVE:
--    Check that a named array aggregate is illegal if it does not cover a
--    contiguous set of index values because a subtype has a static predicate.
--
--  CHANGE HISTORY:
--     03 Jun 2014  RLB    Created test based on existing tests B43201C and
--                         B540001.
--     23 Apr 2021  RLB    Added error location indicators.
